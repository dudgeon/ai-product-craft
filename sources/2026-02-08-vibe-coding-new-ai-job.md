## Summary

Lazar Jovanovic is a full-time professional vibe coder at Lovable. His job is to build both internal tools and customer-facing products purely using AI, while not having a coding background. Covers tactics, workflows, and frameworks for shipping production-quality products using only AI.

5. Why kicking off four or five parallel prototypes is the best way to clarify your thinking
6. Why design skills and taste are going to be the most important skills in the future
7. His "genie and three wishes" mental model for making the most of AI's limitations
