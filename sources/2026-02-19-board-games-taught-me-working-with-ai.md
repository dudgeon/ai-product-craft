summary: "Parrott applied the board game 'teach' framework (pieces → moves → systems → victory condition) to design a compound writing agent. Key output: TASTE.md encoding editorial voice alongside CLAUDE.md; a split two-layer system — 'defaults' file (baseline writing standards) and 'taste' file (empty at start, fills over time). Key lesson: the system's flaws only reveal themselves when you actually use it. Victory condition: each piece of writing makes the next easier. Partial paywall — ~1,500 words accessible."

## Notes

- Partial paywall — ~1,500 words accessible; full article requires Every subscription
- Cross-reference: Parrott is adapting Kieran Klaassen's compound engineering plugin to a writing context — this is a practitioner's translation of [Compound Engineering](2025-12-11-compound-engineering-how-every-codes-agents.md) into a non-engineering domain
- The TASTE.md concept parallels the knowledge-capture-as-side-effect pattern: writing preferences accumulate as the system is used

**What Board Games Taught Me About Working with AI**
*The skills I transferred to my writing agent from playing Settlers of Catan*

I'd been stuck on trying to build my own writing agent for months when I found myself scanning my board game shelf. Suddenly, the problem wasn't about AI anymore.

It was the end of Think Week, Every's twice-yearly retreat where we break to explore possibilities outside the flow of our regular work. The team was in a beach house in Panama, decked out in shorts and sunglasses with palm trees swaying in the background. I was under 10 inches of snow in Ohio, locked in a battle of wills with my dog about going outside.

From my laptop, I watched Austin Tedesco, Every's head of growth, demo a dashboard [content continues behind paywall]

**The teach**

[The board game tradition of explaining pieces before strategy — applied to understanding Kieran Klaassen's compound engineering plugin. Plugin became model for a writing equivalent.]

**The framework maps four stages:**
1. Identifying components (pieces)
2. Understanding possible actions (moves)
3. Recognizing how moves interconnect (systems thinking)
4. Defining success conditions (victory)

**The writing equivalent:**
- Created equivalent roles to engineering plugin's agents and reviewers
- Created TASTE.md file encoding writing preferences alongside CLAUDE.md analog
- Writing loop: brainstorm, interview, outline, draft, edit (adapted from plan-work-review-compound)
- "Each stage serves specific functions; skipping steps produces 'polished garbage.'"

**The two-layer system:**

Key problem encountered: AI got confused — Parrott's (Katie's) preferences showed up in what was supposed to be the user's personal profile. The system was supposed to learn your taste. Instead, it was handing you mine.

Solution: split the system into two layers:
- **Defaults file**: opinionated baseline for good writing standards
- **Taste file**: starts empty, fills up over time with individual user preferences

Key insight: "The engine only reveals its flaws when I actually play."

**Victory condition:**
Each piece of writing makes the next one easier. The system learns the writer's voice, reducing the gap between intention and expression. The larger victory: learning how to work with AI systems thoughtfully.
