# AI PM Craft

A knowledge base for AI-augmented product management — how PMs use AI tools effectively and how product organizations adapt to AI-native ways of working. Every idea is traceable back to its sources with quotes, context, and links.

## Structure

### Sources (`sources/`)

Primary material (articles, podcasts, videos, organic insights) with full attribution. Sources are read, annotated, and processed into discrete knowledge entries. See `sources/_index.md` for the full registry and reading queue.

**Source lifecycle**: `unread` → `reading` → `read` → `processed`

### Knowledge (`knowledge/`)

Extracted, portable knowledge organized into three domains. Each entry is atomic (one idea per file) with source lineage. Entries marked `featured: true` are techniques worth championing organizationally.

**Entry types**: `technique` · `mental-model` · `insight`
**Entry lifecycle**: `draft` → `solid` (multiple sources) → `canonical` (vetted, teachable)

## Knowledge Map

### Product Lifecycle (`product-lifecycle/`)

Techniques and insights mapped to stages of building product — from discovery through shipping and measurement. Will develop sub-domains as content grows.

- [[interactive-prd-writing]] — Templatized rule files + AI follow-up questions for thorough PRDs
- [[task-list-generation-for-observability]] — Decomposing PRDs into nested task lists for observability and control
- [[stepwise-task-execution]] — One-task-at-a-time execution with pause-and-approve checkpoints
- [[context-first-development]] — The biggest mistake in AI-assisted dev is rushing past context

### Horizontal Product & Knowledge Work (`horizontal/`)

Patterns that cut across the product lifecycle — prompting techniques, writing workflows, context engineering.

- [[be-100x-more-specific]] — Forces AI past vague principles into concrete, actionable standards
- [[my-job-your-job-role-delineation]] — Explicit human/AI responsibility partitioning
- [[deliberate-context-selection]] — Hand-picking files for LLM context vs. relying on automatic context
- [[ai-as-writing-coach]] — Structured workflow: thesis validation → blind spots → restructuring

### AI Adoption & Change Management (`ai-adoption/`)

How organizations and individuals adapt to AI-native ways of working — scaling expertise, restructuring teams, driving adoption.

- [[reverse-engineer-judgment-into-ai]] — Have AI discover your implicit criteria, encode into reusable evaluator
- [[scale-manager-expertise-with-ai]] — Automate "0-to-60%" feedback so managers focus on high-leverage work
