# AI PM Craft

A knowledge base for AI-augmented product management — how PMs use AI tools effectively and how product organizations adapt to AI-native ways of working. Every idea is traceable back to its sources with quotes, context, and links.

## Structure

```
ai-pm-craft/
├── sources/           Source material with full attribution and reading status
├── knowledge-base/    Extracted knowledge organized by domain
│   ├── product-lifecycle/{phase}/   Mapped to six lifecycle phases
│   ├── horizontal/                  Cross-cutting skills
│   └── ai-adoption/                 Org change and adoption
└── meta/              Project ontology, taxonomy, and lifecycle framework
```

## Sources

Source material is the raw input — articles, podcasts, newsletters, and organic experience. Each source gets a structured note with attribution, key quotes, and extracted ideas.

**Pipeline**: `unread` → `reading` → `read` → `processed`

Browse all sources and their status in the [Source Registry](sources/), or jump to [unread sources](sources/#unread).

## Knowledge Base

Knowledge entries are ideas extracted from sources and organized by domain. Entries improve over time as more sources corroborate them.

**Entry types**: `technique` · `mental-model` · `insight`
**Entry status**: `draft` → `solid` (multiple sources) → `canonical` (vetted, teachable)

Browse all entries in the [Knowledge Map](knowledge-base/README.md).

## Taxonomy & Meta

Classification rules, lifecycle framework, and entry templates live in `meta/`. See [taxonomy.md](meta/taxonomy.md) for how entries are categorized.

## Status

Early stage. 21 sources captured, 2 fully processed into 10 knowledge entries (all draft). 17 unread sources in the queue. Current entries cluster in Build, Horizontal, and AI Adoption — other lifecycle phases will populate as more sources are processed.
