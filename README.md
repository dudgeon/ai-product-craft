# AI Product Management Craft

A structured learning project to level up as a product manager in the AI/LLM era, and to be able to explain the concepts to others.

## Goal

Build a deep, well-sourced body of knowledge about AI product management — from techniques and mental models to insights about what separates great AI PMs from the rest. Every idea should be traceable back to its sources with quotes, context, and links.

## How This Works

### Source Lifecycle

```
Discover → Capture (unread) → Read → Process → Knowledge Base
```

1. **Discover**: Find an article, video, newsletter, tweet thread
2. **Capture**: Drop in `inbox/` with `project: ai-pm-craft` tag, or create directly in `sources/`
3. **Read**: Mark as `reading` → `read`, add summary and notes
4. **Process**: Extract discrete ideas into knowledge entries with source lineage
5. **Synthesize**: Knowledge entries accumulate citations from multiple sources over time

### Source Files (`sources/`)

Each source is a markdown file with archived content, reading status, and extracted ideas. See `templates/source.md`.

**Status lifecycle**: `unread` → `reading` → `read` → `processed`

### Knowledge Entries (`knowledge/`)

Synthesized ideas organized by type. Each entry is atomic — one idea per file — and tracks lineage back to every source that discusses it. See `templates/knowledge-entry.md`.

**Status lifecycle**: `draft` → `solid` → `canonical`

**Entry types**: `technique`, `mental-model`, `insight`

*The table of contents for all knowledge entries, organized by topic hierarchy. Updated as new entries are created or restructured.*

### Strategy & Vision

*How to set direction for AI products, evaluate opportunities, and make bets.*

<!-- Example entries (uncomment/replace as entries are created):
- [[working-backwards]] — Starting from the customer outcome and reasoning back to requirements
- [[opportunity-sizing-for-ai]] — How traditional TAM/SAM/SOM shifts when AI changes the cost curve

### Shipping & Execution

*How to move AI products from idea to production — scoping, tradeoffs, iteration.*

### Evaluation & Measurement

*How to measure AI product quality, define success metrics, handle non-determinism.*

### User Experience & Design

*Patterns for AI-powered interfaces, managing user expectations, trust calibration.*

### Technical Fluency

*What AI PMs need to understand about models, infra, evals, and the stack — without becoming engineers.*

### Stakeholder & Team Dynamics

*Working with ML engineers, researchers, executives. Communicating uncertainty. Building trust.*

### Career & Growth

*PM career progression, skill development, differentiation in the AI era.*

### Uncategorized
