# AI PM Craft

A knowledge base for AI-augmented product management — how PMs use AI tools effectively and how product organizations adapt to AI-native ways of working. Every idea is traceable back to its sources with quotes, context, and links.

## Structure

```
ai-pm-craft/
├── sources/           Source material with full attribution and reading status
├── knowledge-base/    Extracted knowledge organized by domain
│   ├── product-lifecycle/{phase}/       Mapped to six lifecycle phases (vertical)
│   ├── horizontal/                      Cross-cutting knowledge areas (horizontal)
│   │   ├── practices/                   Atomic portable techniques
│   │   ├── software-delivery/           Delivery methodologies (compound eng, spec-driven dev)

└── meta/              Project ontology, taxonomy, and lifecycle framework
```

## Sources

Source material is the raw input — articles, podcasts, newsletters, and organic experience. Each source gets a structured note with attribution, key quotes, and extracted ideas.

**Pipeline**: `unread` → `reading` → `read` → `processed`

Browse all sources and their status in the [Source Registry](sources/), or jump to [unread sources](sources/#unread).

## Knowledge Base

Knowledge entries are ideas extracted from sources and organized by domain. Entries improve over time as more sources corroborate them.

**Entry types**: `technique` · `mental-model` · `insight`
**Entry status**: `draft` → `solid` (multiple sources) → `canonical` (vetted, teachable)

Browse all entries in the [Knowledge Map](knowledge-base/README.md).

## Taxonomy & Meta

Classification rules, lifecycle framework, and entry templates live in `meta/`. See [taxonomy.md](meta/taxonomy.md) for how entries are categorized.

## Status

Early stage. 25 sources captured, 3 fully processed into 14 knowledge entries (all draft). 19 unread sources in the queue. Current entries span Build, Shape, Horizontal Practices, and AI Adoption. Three new horizontal domains (Software Delivery, Agent Lifecycle, Knowledge Management) established — awaiting source processing to populate.
