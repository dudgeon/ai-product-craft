# Shape/Ship/Sync PM Work Model

## Summary

All PM work falls into three jobs — **Shape the Product** (determining what to build), **Ship the Product** (helping the team deliver), and **Sync the People** (human coordination and alignment) — each with a distinct AI disruption profile. Shape is most disrupted by AI (🤖🤖🤖 overall), Ship moderately (🤖🤖), and Sync least. Within Shape, strategy/vision and goal-setting rate highest for AI disruption (🤖🤖🤖🤖), while design feedback and roadmapping rate lowest (🤖🤖). This model provides a practical lens for mapping PM work, identifying where AI changes daily practice, and deciding where to invest in human vs. AI capabilities.

## How to Apply

Use Shape/Ship/Sync to audit your PM work distribution:

1. **Map your weekly activities** into the three buckets. Most PMs underestimate how much time goes to Ship and Sync vs. Shape.
2. **For Shape tasks** (strategy, vision, goals, specs, discovery, roadmap, design feedback): actively experiment with AI tools. Strategy and discovery work should increasingly be AI-augmented — treat outputs as first drafts to refine.
3. **For Ship tasks** (project management, scope tradeoffs, quality assurance): selectively apply AI to spec writing and release communications. Keep scope-priority tradeoffs human-driven.
4. **For Sync tasks** (stakeholder alignment, team coordination, organizational influence): double down on human skills. These are the PM competencies least likely to be automated and most likely to differentiate.

The model also informs team investment: Shape-heavy work gets AI tooling budget; Sync-heavy work gets training and coaching.

### Disruption ratings by sub-task

| Job | Sub-task | AI Disruption |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| **Shape** | Strategy & vision | 🤖🤖🤖🤖 |
| **Shape** | Setting goals | 🤖🤖🤖🤖 |
| **Shape** | Creating specs | 🤖🤖🤖 |
| **Shape** | Discovery | 🤖🤖🤖 |
| **Shape** | Building roadmaps | 🤖🤖 |
| **Shape** | Design feedback | 🤖🤖 |
| **Ship** | (overall) | 🤖🤖 |
| **Sync** | (overall) | 🤖 |
