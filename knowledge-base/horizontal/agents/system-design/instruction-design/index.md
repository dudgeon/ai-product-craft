# Instruction Design — CLAUDE.md, agents.md & Behavioral Configuration

The practice of defining agent behavior through persistent markdown instruction files. How you structure, compose, auto-load, and evolve behavioral directives — CLAUDE.md, agents.md, .cursorrules, system prompts — so that every session starts aligned without re-explanation.

## Entries

- [Structured Context Loading](structured-context-loading.md) — Purpose-built files (plans, guidelines, journeys) loaded before each interaction to align agent behavior across sessions
- [Knowledge Capture as Side Effect](knowledge-capture-as-side-effect.md) — Design agent systems so knowledge capture is a byproduct of corrections, not a separate task; extends to self-driving documentation `solid`
