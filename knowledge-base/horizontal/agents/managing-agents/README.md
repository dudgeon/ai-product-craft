# Managing Agents — The Human-Agent Management Relationship

The practice of managing AI agents as autonomous participants — deciding what work to delegate, how to delegate effectively, evaluating output, and developing agents over time.

**Thesis**: AI makes talent abundant and cheap. What's scarce is knowing what to ask for — scoping problems, defining deliverables, recognizing quality, giving feedback. Management skills, not AI literacy, are the competitive advantage in the agentic era.

This is distinct from [system design](../system-design/) (tool-agnostic patterns for *building* agents) and [harnesses](../harnesses/) (platform-specific knowledge). Managing agents is about the *relationship* between human and agent — the same relationship a good manager has with their reports, adapted for AI participants.

- [Talent-to-Direction Scarcity Shift](talent-to-direction-scarcity-shift.md) — AI inverts traditional scarcity: talent is now abundant, knowing what to ask for is the bottleneck

## Sub-domains

### [Task-Agent Fit](task-fit/) — When to Delegate

Decision frameworks for what work to give agents — when delegation is worthwhile, risk assessment, the jagged frontier of agent capability.

- [Delegation Decision Framework](task-fit/delegation-decision-framework.md) — Three-variable equation (Human Baseline Time × Probability of Success × AI Process Time) for when delegation pays off

### [Delegation Craft](delegation/) — How to Delegate

How to effectively hand off work to agents — instructions, documentation formats, defining done, checkpoints, iteration strategies.

- [Delegation Documentation as Agent Prompts](delegation/delegation-documentation-as-prompts.md) — Every field's delegation docs (PRDs, shot lists, Five Paragraph Orders) are AI prompts; common elements pattern

### Evaluation & Feedback — How to Assess

Assessing agent output, giving feedback, iteration cost management, quality recognition, feedback loops.
