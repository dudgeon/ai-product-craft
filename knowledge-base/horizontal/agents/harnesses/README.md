# Agent Harnesses — Platform-Specific Knowledge

Knowledge, guides, and practices specific to individual agent platforms and tools. Where [skills](../skills/) capture tool-agnostic patterns, harness entries capture what's unique to a particular tool — setup, configuration, capabilities, limitations, and best practices.

## Entries

- [Cursor: Structured AI Development](cursor-structured-ai-development.md) — Three-file rule system, @-includes, MCP config, and Repo Prompt for structured workflows in Cursor

Future entries might include:
- Claude Code — setup, CLAUDE.md conventions, skills, hooks, MCP configuration
- Devin — knowledge items, session management, team workflows
