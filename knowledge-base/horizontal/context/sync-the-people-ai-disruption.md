# Sync the People — AI Disruption Profile

## Summary

"Sync the People" is the PM job of **human coordination and alignment** — stakeholder alignment, team coordination, and organizational influence. Of the three PM jobs (Shape/Ship/Sync), Sync is **least disrupted by AI** (🤖 overall). These are the PM competencies least likely to be automated and most likely to differentiate human PMs.

## How to Apply

1. **Double down on human skills** for Sync work — stakeholder management, organizational influence, team coordination
2. **Invest in training and coaching** rather than AI tooling for Sync-heavy work
3. **Recognize Sync as a durable competitive advantage** — as Shape and Ship tasks get automated, the PM who can align people becomes more valuable, not less
