# Software Methodology

How AI fundamentally changes software delivery paradigms — not just augmenting existing phases, but reshaping the methodology itself.

This domain is distinct from:
- **Product Lifecycle** entries (which augment a specific phase within the current methodology)
- **Horizontal** entries (which are lifecycle-agnostic PM skills and tools)
- **Adjacent Disciplines** (which track how collaborator disciplines adopt AI)

The test: is this about *how the methodology itself is evolving* rather than *how to use AI within the current methodology*?

## Entries

- [Compound Engineering Loop](compound-engineering-loop.md) — Four-step loop (Plan → Work → Assess → Compound) where each feature makes the next easier; inverts traditional complexity debt
- [OAI Harness Engineering](oai-harness-engineering.md) — Zero manually-written code at scale; humans steer (environments, intent, feedback loops), agents execute everything; rigid architecture + mechanical enforcement + continuous entropy management

## Related Areas

- [Spec-Driven Development](../adjacent-disciplines/spec-driven-development.md) — A related methodology shift: software as specs + tests with zero implementation code
- [Knowledge Capture as Side Effect](../horizontal/agents/system-design/instruction-design/knowledge-capture-as-side-effect.md) — The mechanism that makes the "compound" step work: corrections become persistent institutional memory
