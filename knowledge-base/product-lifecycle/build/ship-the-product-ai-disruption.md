# Ship the Product — AI Disruption Profile

## Summary

"Ship the Product" is the PM job of **helping the team deliver** — project management, scope-priority tradeoffs, and quality assurance. Of the three PM jobs (Shape/Ship/Sync), Ship is **moderately disrupted by AI** (🤖🤖 overall). AI can help with spec writing and release communications, but scope-priority tradeoffs remain human-driven.

## How to Apply

1. **Selectively apply AI** to spec writing and release communications within Ship work
2. **Keep scope-priority tradeoffs human-driven** — these require organizational context and judgment that AI lacks
3. **Focus human investment** on the judgment calls: what to cut, what to defer, what quality bar to hold
