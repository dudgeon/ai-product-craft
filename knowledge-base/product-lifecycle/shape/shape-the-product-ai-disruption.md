# Shape the Product — AI Disruption Profile

## Summary

"Shape the Product" is the PM job of determining **what to build** — strategy, vision, goal-setting, creating specs, discovery, roadmapping, and design feedback. Of the three PM jobs (Shape/Ship/Sync), Shape is **most disrupted by AI** (🤖🤖🤖 overall). Counterintuitively, the most "strategic" sub-tasks (strategy & vision, goal-setting) rate highest for AI disruption (🤖🤖🤖🤖), while design feedback and roadmapping rate lowest (🤖🤖).

## How to Apply

1. **Actively experiment with AI tools** for Shape work — strategy, discovery, and spec writing should increasingly be AI-augmented
2. **Treat AI outputs as first drafts** to refine, not final answers
3. **Invest AI tooling budget here** — this is where the highest leverage is

### Disruption ratings by sub-task

| Setting goals | 🤖🤖🤖🤖 |
| Creating specs | 🤖🤖🤖 |
| Discovery | 🤖🤖🤖 |
| Building roadmaps | 🤖🤖 |
| Design feedback | 🤖🤖 |
