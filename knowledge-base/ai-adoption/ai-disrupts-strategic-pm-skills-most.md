# AI Disrupts Strategic PM Skills Most

## Summary

Counterintuitively, AI will most profoundly disrupt the high-level, historically most-valued PM skills — strategy, vision, goal-setting, and discovery — rather than the soft skills many assume it will replace first. This inverts popular belief: most PMs expect AI to automate low-level execution and communication tasks, but AI excels at exactly what strategic thinking requires — analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns, and generating novel insights (as demonstrated by AlphaGo's Move 37). Meanwhile, distinctly human capabilities — stakeholder alignment, cross-functional coordination, empathy, nuanced judgment — become MORE valuable as differentiators between PMs and between companies.

## How to Apply

When planning AI adoption in PM workflows, prioritize strategic tooling (competitive analysis, opportunity identification, goal-setting, financial modeling) over execution automation — this is where AI provides the highest leverage.

For individual PMs: don't stop building strategic-thinking muscle, but learn to use AI as a strategic analysis partner. The PM's value shifts from "person who generates the strategy" to "person who knows what data to feed AI and asks the right questions." Rachitsky frames this as becoming "very good at knowing what data to feed it and asking the right questions."

For PM leaders: recalibrate how you evaluate PM talent. As AI handles more strategic analysis, look for PMs who combine AI-augmented strategic output with superior human coordination skills. The best PMs will use AI for strategy AND excel at the human work that AI can't touch.

Simultaneously, invest in developing soft skills as a conscious differentiator — communication, stakeholder alignment, product sense, creativity. These are the skills that won't be commoditized and will increasingly separate great PMs from good ones.

**Key quote**: "AI will have the most profound impact on the high-level (and historically most valued) skills of product management: developing a strategy, crafting a vision, identifying new opportunities, and setting goals. Furthermore, soft skills like product sense, communication, creativity, and being the glue that enables a team to operate at their very best will become even more important (and a differentiator among companies)."

**What this source adds**: The foundational articulation of this counterintuitive insight, backed by a granular 5-point disruption rating across PM sub-tasks. Rachitsky uses AlphaGo's Move 37 as evidence that AI discovers strategic patterns humans miss, and cites Jensen Huang and Sam Altman as convergent signals that historically high-level skills are being solved by AI.
