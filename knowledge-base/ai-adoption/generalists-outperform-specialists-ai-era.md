# Generalists Outperform Specialists in AI Era

## Summary

As AI compresses execution, the advantage of deep specialization shrinks. Specialists built their edge partly on the cost of *doing* the work — a decade of accumulated technique, muscle memory, and domain knowledge that took years to amass. AI can now execute at a high level in many of those domains on demand. What it cannot do is think across disciplines, notice when a problem in one domain has an answer in another, or bring curiosity about the broader system.

Boris Cherny's observation: the most effective engineers he knows cross over disciplines. The people who will be most rewarded in the AI era won't just be AI-native — they'll be curious generalists who can think about the broader problem they're solving. This isn't about being mediocre at everything; it's about the relative value shift when execution becomes available on demand.

## How to Apply

- **For individual career development**: Deliberately cultivate breadth alongside your deep expertise. Pick one adjacent domain per year to genuinely understand — not survey-level, but "can do real work in it with AI help" level. For PMs: engineering depth, design systems, data analysis, customer success patterns.
- **For hiring**: When comparing candidates, weight cross-disciplinary thinking more heavily than specialists in a single area. Look for engineers who have shipped products, PMs who have written code, designers who can read a financial model.
- **For team structure**: Consider deliberately mixing disciplines at the team level and providing AI tooling that enables cross-disciplinary execution. An engineer who can do PM work with AI support is more versatile than two specialists who can't cross.
- **The "100x generalist" pattern**: AI allows a curious generalist to execute at a high level in 3–5 domains rather than 1. The person who can hold the whole problem — product, engineering, data, customer — is a qualitatively different contributor than the specialist.

This is a prediction with a timeframe uncertainty. The shift is clearly directional but the magnitude and speed depend on model capability trajectories. The safe bet: cultivate breadth now, while the specialist-to-generalist transition is still early.

**Key quote**: "Try to be a generalist more than you have in the past. Some of the most effective engineers cross over disciplines. The people who will be rewarded most won't just be AI-native—they'll be curious generalists who can think about the broader problem they're solving."

**What this source adds**: Cherny's observation comes from watching engineers inside Anthropic — the company at the frontier of AI capability. He has direct visibility into what's working at maximum AI adoption. The observation is behavioral ("the most effective engineers I know"), not aspirational.
