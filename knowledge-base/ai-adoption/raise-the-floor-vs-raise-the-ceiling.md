# Raise the Floor vs Raise the Ceiling

## Summary

AI adoption in organizations operates on two distinct axes: **raising the floor** (making everyone more capable) and **raising the ceiling** (pushing the frontier of what's possible for power users). These require different tools, different change management strategies, and different success metrics — but both are necessary for meaningful organizational transformation.

**Raising the floor** means bringing baseline AI capability to everyone in the org — including people who would never write a prompt from scratch. Tools like Google Gems, Custom GPTs, and Claude Projects are ideal here: packaged, shareable, low-friction runtimes that encode expert judgment into reusable AI tools anyone can use. The change management motion is distribution and adoption — get pre-built tools into people's hands, lower the barrier to first use, measure breadth of adoption.

**Raising the ceiling** means enabling power users and early adopters to push into genuinely new workflows — agentic methods, multi-tool orchestration, AI-native development patterns. This is where Claude Code, Cursor, MCP integrations, and custom agent architectures live. The change management motion is enablement and experimentation — create space for exploration, share learnings back, measure depth of capability.

The risk is over-indexing on one axis. Floor-only strategies create a veneer of adoption without transformative impact. Ceiling-only strategies create pockets of excellence that don't spread. Effective AI change management sequences and balances both.

## How to Apply

**When to use**: When designing an AI adoption strategy for a team or organization. When evaluating whether current efforts are balanced. When deciding which AI tools and initiatives to invest in.

**The diagnostic**:
1. What are we doing to raise the floor? (Gems, packaged GPTs, shared templates, no-code AI tools)
2. What are we doing to raise the ceiling? (Agentic tooling, custom workflows, power-user enablement)
3. Are these connected? (Do ceiling insights get packaged into floor tools? Do floor users have a path to ceiling capabilities?)

**Sequencing considerations**:
- Floor-first is often the right starting move — it builds organizational comfort with AI and creates demand for more
- Ceiling work generates the insights and patterns that become the next generation of floor tools
- The two should feed each other: power users discover patterns → patterns get packaged into runtimes → runtimes raise the floor → new baseline creates demand for the next ceiling push

**Tool mapping**:
- **Floor tools**: Google Gems, Custom GPTs, Claude Projects, Zapier AI workflows, pre-built templates
- **Ceiling tools**: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, MCP integrations, custom agent architectures, agentic workflows
- **Bridge tools**: Shared prompt libraries, skill files, documented workflows that translate ceiling discoveries into floor-accessible patterns

## Origin

**Context**: Observation from thinking about AI adoption patterns in non-AI-native organizations — the tension between broad shallow adoption and deep narrow adoption.
**How you use it**: As a lens for evaluating whether an AI adoption strategy is balanced and self-reinforcing, and for classifying AI tools by which axis they primarily serve.
**Why it works**: It names the two distinct motions that "AI adoption" actually requires, prevents conflating them, and creates a framework for sequencing investments.

*If you later find external sources that discuss this idea, add a Sources section alongside this Origin section and update origin to "both".*
