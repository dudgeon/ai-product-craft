# Knowledge Map

Extracted knowledge organized by domain. Every entry traces back to one or more sources with quotes, context, and links. See `meta/taxonomy.md` for classification rules.

**Entry types**: `technique` · `mental-model` · `insight`
**Entry status**: `draft` → `solid` (multiple sources) → `canonical` (vetted, teachable)

## Product Lifecycle

Six phases. Entries sit flat within phase folders; the `component` frontmatter field records the most specific applicable component. See `meta/lifecycle-framework-v2.md` for full phase lineage and AI-PM emphasis.

## Horizontal Product & Knowledge Work

Patterns that cut across the product lifecycle — prompting techniques, writing workflows, context engineering, workflow design.

- [Be 100x More Specific](horizontal/be-100x-more-specific.md) — Forces AI past vague principles into concrete, actionable standards
- [My Job Your Job Role Delineation](horizontal/my-job-your-job-role-delineation.md) — Explicit human/AI responsibility partitioning
- [Deliberate Context Selection](horizontal/deliberate-context-selection.md) — Hand-picking files for LLM context vs. relying on automatic context
- [AI as Writing Coach](horizontal/ai-as-writing-coach.md) — Structured workflow: thesis validation → blind spots → restructuring
- [Stepwise Task Execution](horizontal/stepwise-task-execution.md) — One-task-at-a-time execution with pause-and-approve checkpoints
- [Shape/Ship/Sync PM Work Model](horizontal/shape-ship-sync-pm-work-model.md) — Three-job framework for PM work with AI disruption ratings per sub-task

## AI Adoption & Change Management

How organizations and individuals adapt to AI-native ways of working — scaling expertise, restructuring teams, driving adoption.

- [Reverse Engineer Judgment Into AI](ai-adoption/reverse-engineer-judgment-into-ai.md) — Have AI discover your implicit criteria, encode into reusable evaluator
- [Scale Manager Expertise With AI](ai-adoption/scale-manager-expertise-with-ai.md) — Automate "0-to-60%" feedback so managers focus on high-leverage work
- [AI Disrupts Strategic PM Skills Most](ai-adoption/ai-disrupts-strategic-pm-skills-most.md) — Counterintuitively, AI most disrupts high-level strategic PM skills, not soft skills
