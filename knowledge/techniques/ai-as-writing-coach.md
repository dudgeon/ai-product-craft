# AI as Writing Coach

## Summary

A structured workflow for using AI to sharpen written communication — not by having AI write for you, but by using it as a thinking partner that challenges and strengthens your arguments. The workflow progresses through four stages: brain dump validation, argument strengthening, blind spot detection, and structural clarity. The key principle: AI helps you "make it right" rather than validating that it's already right. The process always ends with you doing the final rewrite.

## How to Apply

**When to use**: Any high-stakes written communication — strategy memos, newsletter posts, product briefs, presentations, proposals. Especially effective when you need to influence stakeholders or get "pulled into" strategic conversations.

**Steps**:
1. **Brain dump → Thesis validation**: Write a raw first draft with no filter. Then ask AI: "Can you succinctly express my thesis back to me and my main supporting points?" If AI summarizes accurately, you're on track. If not, your thinking isn't clear yet — clarify before polishing.
2. **Strengthen the argument**: Ask "How can I make this more compelling?" Use AI suggestions to expand your own thinking — not to rewrite.
3. **Detect blind spots**: Ask "What blind spots might I have?" AI flags over-indexing on one audience, underplaying structural forces, false equivalences, weak supporting evidence.
4. **Restructure and polish**: Ask AI to suggest a better structure for clarity. Then do the final rewrite yourself, incorporating all feedback.

**For AI PMs**: This technique directly applies to writing PRDs, strategy docs, and stakeholder communications. The "thesis playback" step (asking AI to summarize your argument) is also useful for validating whether product requirements are clear enough — if AI can't summarize them, neither can your team.

**Key quote**: "Try to get the AI to help you make it right as opposed to assuming that it's right and getting the AI to validate that."
**What this source adds**: Gridley positions this as a career advancement technique — the best way to get invited to strategic meetings is to write sharply enough that your ideas get shared around. The AI writing coach workflow is designed to produce writing that has that effect. The emphasis on ending with a human rewrite ensures the output is authentically yours.
